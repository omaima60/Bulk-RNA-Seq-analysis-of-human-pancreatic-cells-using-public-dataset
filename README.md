# Bulk-RNA-Seq-analysis-of-human-pancreatic-cells-using-public-dataset

This project performs bulk rna-seq data analysis on human pancreatic islet cells using dataset GSE86468. The pipeline includes data retrieval from GEO using SRA Toolkit, quality control with FastQC, read trimming with Trimmomatic, alignment to the human reference using HISAT2, gene quantification with featureCounts, normalization and differential gene expression analysis with DESeq2, visualization(PCA, heatmap, and volcano plot), and 

The analysis compare 3 Non-Diabetic samples (single end) against 3 Diabetic samples (single end).

All tools used are open-source and run on Ubuntu
